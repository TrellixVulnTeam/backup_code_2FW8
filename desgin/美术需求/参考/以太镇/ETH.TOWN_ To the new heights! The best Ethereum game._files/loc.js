We have a lot of ideas and a lot of plans for it. It is designed to be not just a finished product we release at some point, but evolving and expanding. We will be supporting the game, maintaining an active and friendly community and adding more content and mechanics. We will share just the very beginning.\n\nThe project roadmap is following:\n  * May: Limited access beta (application form at https://eth.town):\n  * June: Full launch\n  * June: POWH event\n  * July: 2 additional mini games\n  * July: CryptoKitties event\n  * August: CryptoCountries event","presale.about.6":"## 团队\n\n 该游戏由On5游戏开发工作室开发。该工作室通常专注于手机游戏，创新很酷，而以太网平台对于尝试制作模拟经营游戏很适合。","presale.tokens.1":"## ETH.TOWN代币\n\n ETH.TOWN代币，或是投资者代币，是ETH.TOWN的核心游戏组件。在游戏中，我们所有的代币持有者将自动获得所有游戏参与者活动所产生的利润的一部分。（确实是投资者的天堂）比如，如果一个资产交易完成，ETH数额的最大份额将作为利润交付给交易的双方，第二份额累计给代币持有者，而非常小的第三部分归为开放商。在所有代币持有者中，ETH根据他们所持有的代币份额自动进行分配。您可以直接从平台上取走您赚取的ETH。","presale.tokens.2":"但这不是使用代币的唯一方式。他们是您可以用来购买炫酷的东西的货币。比如，所有和英雄相关的操作，您都需要支付投资者代币。而大多是的迷您游戏也是由代币支持的。\n\n 从技术上来说，该代币是ETH.TOWN游戏中的货币，而他们也是一个兼容ERC-20的代币。这个代币绝不能直接从游戏或是游戏组织者处购买，并只会通过游戏中的特定操作奖励，以及在预售期间作为购买游戏内物品的额外奖励。然而，玩家间可以自由交换代币，比如通过EtherDelta交易他们。","presale.tokens.3":"## 代币和预售\n\n 当您在预售时购买时，您将**同时**得到该物品和特定数额的（每个消费的Ether获得200个代币）投资者代币。这将是唯一一个可以通过支付Ether获得代币的方式，尽管是间接的。\n\n 代币非常酷特别是在游戏早期，因为游戏运行的方式，您将永远没法直接购买他们，在发布后，您也无法获得很多。\n\n 假设，我们在第一周达到了100K ETH的营业额。假设投资者得到2%的份额（大多数情况下更多），那么有2K ETH进入分配给投资者的利润。如果假设，我们在预售期间，销售了价值400个ETH的物品，这意味着每100个代币（您消费1个ETH会得到的）会在游戏第一周结束时产生大约5个ETH。我们知道这个听起来很疯狂，但在加密领域这又有什么新鲜的呢？\n\n 购买的物品将在游戏发布时交付，而代币会自动马上发送。您可以马上再EtherDelta上进行交易。","presale.legal.agree.tos":"通过参与预售，您接受服务条款和隐私政策。","presale.legal.short.link":"参与前，请仔细阅读这个重要信息。","presale.legal.short.title":"重要法律信息","presale.legal.short.text":"通过参加ETH.TOWn的预售，您接受服务条款和隐私政策。确保您已阅读文档并同意条款，您可以在页面底部找到它们的链接。\n\n 除了同意这些文件外，充分理解很重要：\n *ETH.TOWN是一个电脑游戏；\n *通过ETH.TOWN销售的商品是游戏内的虚拟物品；\n *ETH.TOWN的代币是游戏内的货币，它们不代表任何公司，企业或者项目中的股份；\n *游戏组织者不出售ETH.TOWN的代币，分配的代币不资助任何公司或项目；\n *游戏组织者尽最大努力确保游戏过程遵循声明的规则和游戏机制，但虚拟物品一经出售，不提供任何形式的退货保障。；\n *发送Ether到ETH.TOWN和智能合约，是电脑游戏的一部分，这不是真实的投资。","presale.legal.long.title":"服务条款","presale.legal.long.text":"\n## Summary\n\nPlease read these terms of service and use (“Terms”) relating to the ETH.TOWN game carefully.

When a certain number of players added something to a cauldron (10 people for cauldron #1, 3 people for other cauldrons), countdown timer starts.\n\n## Picking winners\n\nWhen the timer runs out, our system picks the winner using numbers from the blockchain (no random numbers, it uses hash of the last block at the time the timer runs out as the seed), and reports them to the smart contract, which awards players accordingly. Chance to be picked as each of 3 winners is directly proportional to the portion contributed to the cauldron by the given player. Logs of all draws are stored and available for everyone's review.\n\nAwarding takes around 2 minutes because the system needs to wait until the Ethereum blockchain reaches consensus on the exact form of the last block and its hash, and time for the generated transaction to be mined.\n\n## Rewards\n\nWinner 1 gets a share with base percentage of 50%, winner 2: 35%, winner 3: 15%. The percentage is then multiplied by 91.5%—99% depending on the player's character level (level 0 or no character: 91.5%, level 15 Star: 99%).\n\nFor ETIT Cauldrons, the rest of tokens are destroyed (burned).\n\nIn case of ETH Cauldrons, of the rest (the resulting percents never sum up to 100%), 5% goes to the owner of Infernal Horse Character.
