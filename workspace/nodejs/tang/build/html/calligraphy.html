  <h1 class="title-name">Ouyang Xun</h1>
  <p>Ouyang Xun (歐陽詢, 557-641), courtesy name Xinben (信本), was a Confucian scholar and calligrapher of the early Tang
    Dynasty. He was born in Hunan, Changsha, to a family of government officials; and died in modern Anhui province.</p>

  <p>Ouyang Xun was a talented student who read a great deal of classics. He served under the Sui Dynasty in 611 as
    Imperial Doctor. During the Tang Dynasty, he was a censor and scholar at the Hongwen Academy, where he taught
    calligraphy. He later became the Imperial Calligrapher and inscribed several major imperial steles.</p>

  <p>One day, during an outing with his friends, Ouyang came upon a stele inscribed by Suo Jing (a famous calligrapher
    of the Jin Dynasty), and felt the inscription was really mediocre. However, he believed there must be something
    outstanding about the stele, since Suo was hailed as a great calligrapher. So he stood for a long while in front of
    the stele, studying the characters and strokes with utmost care. He went on to explore the stele for three days, and
    finally realized the secret of using a brush, hence further perfecting his calligraphy.</p>

  <p>Ouyang Xun’s calligraphy, largely kaishu (regular script), was known for its sense of order and structure and was
    called “Ou Style” by later generations. Along with Yu Shinan, Chu Suiliang and Xun Ji, he became known as one of the
    Four Great Calligraphers of the Early Tang Period. His regular script is also regarded as one of the top four in the
    Chinese history. The other three are Yan Zhenqing (顏真卿), Liu Gongquan (柳公權) and Zhao Mengfu (趙孟頫).</p>
